# NUS_MIT-Datathon-2020-data-analysis

Pain is a common occurrence in critically ill patients, with 50-70% of both medical and surgical ICU patients experiencing moderate to severe pain at rest 1,2. Treatment of acute pain within the ICU can lead to improved outcomes and decreased length of ICU intervention 3, whilst inadequate analgesia can lead to chronic physical and psychological morbidity 4. 

We examine the temporal relationship between pain scoring and subsequent opioid and sedative boluses in mechanical ventilated patients in the intensive care unit(RASS score)
