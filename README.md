Pain is a common occurrence in critically ill patients, with 50-70% of both medical and surgical ICU patients experiencing moderate to severe pain at rest 1,2. Treatment of acute pain within the ICU can lead to improved outcomes and decreased length of ICU intervention 3, whilst inadequate analgesia can lead to chronic physical and psychological morbidity 4. 

Sedation is used as both an anxiolytic and an amnesic to mitigate against the effects of invasive ICU therapies, particularly mechanical ventilation. The benefits of sedation in the mechanically ventilated patient include anxiolysis, improved tolerance of ventilator support, facilitating nursing care and decreasing the stress response 5.

The most recent Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines on the management of pain, agitation, delirium, immobility and sleep (PADIS)5 advocate for an analgosedation regime, with opioids being first-line for analgesia. Additionally, analgesic and sedative regimes should be targeted to pain assessment and sedation assessment, respectively. It is often difficult to discern, in the agitated patient receiving mechanical ventilation, the cause of the agitation. Even in the presence of pain, it may be plausible that sedation be given to the patient to mitigate the psychological effects of acute pain. There have been no studies to date that have examined this dichotomy.

We examine the temporal relationship between pain scoring and Richmond agitation-sedation score(RASS score)
